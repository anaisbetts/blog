At A Serious Business, Inc. it's important to us to ship early and often. It's a cultural carryover [from our days at GitHub](https://github.blog/2012-09-24-how-we-ship-github-for-windows/).

> At GitHub, we ship a lot. We think itâ€™s so important to ship often, we even have a shipping mascot and matching emoji (`:shipit:`). Why do we do this?

The shipping mascot mentioned in the post is the famous Ship-It Squirrel!

![Ship It Squirrel](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19977/122805857-796f9480-d27e-11eb-8ee8-ccb335d14f23.png).

In chat, we'd often invoke the Ship-It Squirrel (and its kin) to encourage each other to ship it via the [hubot-shipit](https://github.com/hubot-scripts/hubot-shipit) script. With Abbot, it's possible to build such a skill without any code as Abbot supports this pattern of pulling a random item from a list as a first-class citizen via the `custom-list` skill. The following is a demonstration:

```
@abbot custom-list add shipit
@abbot shipit add https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19977/122805857-796f9480-d27e-11eb-8ee8-ccb335d14f23.png
```

Now in chat, when you run `@abbot shipit` you get the ship-it squirrel. Of course, at any time you can add more ship-it squirrels.

```
@abbot shipit add https://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lybw63nzPp1r5bvcto1_500.jpg
@abbot shipit add https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19977/122805749-55ac4e80-d27e-11eb-9ec5-ea5cd551a9a2.png
```

The next time you run `@abbot shipit`, Abbot will return a random item from the `shipit` list.

Hopefully your teammates will use such lists responsibly, but just in case someone adds an image that is not conducive to a culture of shipping, you can log in to [the Abbot List Skills page](https://ab.bot/lists) to find out who added which items.

Custom lists are a simple but powerful and fun feature of Abbot. The `joke` skill is implemented as a custom list. We use custom lists to track ideas for new skills and to answer questions in the style of Magic 8 Ball. What interesting lists will you create?
